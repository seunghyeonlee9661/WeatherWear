## Project Introduction
This repository presents the results of a team project from the 2024 Sparta Coding Club - Innovation Camp.

**WeatherWear** is a system designed to recommend daily outfits based on the weather. By analyzing the weather data based on the user's location, it suggests appropriate outfits using factors like clothing type and color.

Key features include:
- Personalized outfit recommendations based on today's weather, your wardrobe, similar past outfits, and other users' outfit choices.
- Register and share your Outfit of the Day (OOTD).
- Search for outfits using keywords, weather icons, clothing types, and colors.
- Future updates will include real-time notifications, event-based outfit recommendations, and specific date suggestions.
- Performance optimization through load testing for stable server operations.
